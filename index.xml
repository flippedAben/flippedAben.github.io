      <description>Honesty
My brother crashed at my place for two to three months to finish an internship in Austin. Today, he left. On the way back home, from the airport, I could feel what every writer describes as the precursor to crying. Part of it is the throat swelling. Part of it is the eye closing.
I want to understand myself more, so I tried my best to be honest. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try to put on a tough act.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the meaningless of everything. The universe is inherently pointless. I think philosophers like to call it nihilism. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard people say that although it is a depressing thought, it is actually very uplifting. The main idea is that you get to create the meaning to your life. This is as liberating as it gets.
I read some Reddit comment a while back. I&amp;rsquo;m paraphrasing here:
 The next logical leap is to ask what nihilism says about nihilism.</description>
