      <description>Context I watched a YouTube video about Destiny interviewing Dr. K. Near the end, Destiny asks Alok: what is the number one tip he would give to someone who wants to be more mentally healthy. The tip is to know yourself. Quoting Alok:
 Understand yourself in the same way your try to understand external things.
 I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really thought about it this way. The way I try to understand anything externally is through the scientific method (usually).</description>

      <description>Many dog walkers have passed by my car. Those who listened closely heard a faint meow. That&amp;rsquo;s because there was a little kitten inside the engine bay.
I decided to go grocery shopping one Saturday morning. When I sat down at the steering wheel, I saw a paper note slid beneath the wind shield wiper. I read a sloppy cursive that said a kitten was in my car. At first, I was confused.</description>

      <description>Honesty
My brother crashed at my place for two to three months to finish an internship in Austin. Today, he left. On the way back home, from the airport, I could feel what every writer describes as the precursor to crying. Part of it is the throat swelling. Part of it is the eye closing.
I want to understand myself more, so I tried my best to be honest. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try to put on a tough act.</description>

      <title>Meta Nihilism</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the meaningless of everything. The universe is inherently pointless. I think philosophers like to call it nihilism. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard people say that although it is a depressing thought, it is actually very uplifting. The main idea is that you get to create the meaning to your life. This is as liberating as it gets.
I read some Reddit comment a while back. I&amp;rsquo;m paraphrasing here:
 The next logical leap is to ask what nihilism says about nihilism.</description>
