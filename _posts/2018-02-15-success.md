I started my new morning routine. It consists of doing 10 of each kind of kick
on each legs. I do more on the days where yesterday racked up a lot of points.
When I catch myself lose focus, I add a point.

I was in an ambivalent mood. I wasn't really happy or really sad. I was in the
middle with a very slight bias for sadness.

Anyways, I looked forward to Tukong, hoping I'd get a chance to redeem myself
and practice the throws we did previously in the week.

At training, we first did several sets of form style kicks. In this style, after
extension, we hold for a second and continue. It really helps focus on control
and bring out the weak points of your kick/body. For example, on front kick, my
kicking foot can only get to around knee height, since my hamstrings are really
tight.

Next were throws. The same two that we did yesterday. Ron wasn't there, but I
had much more focus than last time. It went well, and I got some compliments on
my throws. But of course, I try not to get too flattered or too angry at
insults. No ego.

I'm thankful. After Tukong, I felt much better.
