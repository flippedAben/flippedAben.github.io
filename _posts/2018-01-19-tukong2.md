title: Alternating Clockwork Roundhouses
categories: tukong

I got to training early and saw everyone cleaning. I cleaned the bathroom mirror
and the middle mirror in the back of the room. I was glad I got to clean.

I learned a new drill today. Paul and I both had paddle targets. We held them
around chest height. We stood facing each other in sparring stance. I did a
sliding roundhouse kick. He did a sliding roundhouse kick. Repeat.

Master Ali stopped us and said we needed to go faster. It needed to be like
clockwork. He demo'ed it again with Brad. Brad did a sliding roundhouse, and
before Brad's kicking foot hit the ground, Master Ali did a sliding roundhouse.
Repeat.

So, we tried to go faster. We did five sets of ten each. And after the fifth
set, of course, we did it one more time. Then, we did the same drill with
sliding hook kicks.

For the last ten minutes, we did form things.
