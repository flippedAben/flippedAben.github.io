Before adult class, there was the children's class. Master Ali had them line up
and asked them a question. They answered but Master Ali said they were too
soft. He asked them what their first line of offense was. It was their voice. He
wanted them to respond loudly to show that they had confidence in their
response.

It really is a powerful weapon.

I felt bad because I hadn't been loud enough in some training sessions.

I have this habit of not being confident. Frequently, after I say something,
I add the lackluster _I guess_ or _But this is only what I think_. This ties
into climbing as well. On the harder routes, I simply don't have the confidence
to do it. I don't trust myself that much. That's why my focus on my physical
activities is on trusting myself. Trusting that my toes won't break when I kick
the target. Trusting that my feet will stick when I stand on a tiny hold.

I've thought of myself as a coward. But then I heard the cliche about how the
coward runs from fear, while the brave stands with it. Now, I'm just in between.
