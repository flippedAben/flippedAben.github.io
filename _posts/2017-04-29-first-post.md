This is just a test post. But, I will still write about something.

Depression is a problem, and I don't think anyone knows the _true_ cause of it
in anyone who has it. The common thought that first comes to me is that it
should depend on the person. It sounds obvious and is probably true. I mean, I
don't believe that there is a single source that is creating trouble for
everyone.

From somewhere on the internet, I heard about the lack of goals being a part of
a depressed person's agenda. I don't know which one causes the other, or if the
relation is only a correlation, or maybe even an imaginative observation. What I
heard rang true with me. I don't consider myself a chronically depressed
student, but I have my times that I feel that way. Those times are when I am
doing absolutely nothing productive, when I am not striving towards anything,
and especially when I'm not doing anything meaningful. When I feel that way, I
know that I should do something, but the thought process I have is a destructive
cycle of negativity. It's hard to motivate myself away from that.

In addition to a lack of goals, this anonymous poster also mentioned a great
sense of self worth, great enough to the point of harm. What I mean by this is
people saying things like "Oh, look at that person on Facebook who has all this.
I'm just as good as a person, and I don't have any of that." And then at least
subconsciously, they think something like _I'm not good enough_.
